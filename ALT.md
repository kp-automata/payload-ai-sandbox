## Alternative Solutions

### Targets
#### Normalized difference vegetation index
- Fixed algorithm
- Measures plant health and coverage
- Can extrapolate to drought growth
- Id what type of sensors needed. Do we need a multispectral camera or can we
use a cheaper camera / just infared sensor
#### Cloud-climate feedback
- Identifiy cloud types and coverage over target area
- Use machine learning to classify and create bounding boxes in image area
- Ideally use a low resource camera
- There is a direct connection to climate change and cloud coverage
- See if agricultural practices like cloud seeding are affecting cloud coverage
- There a gap in the market (cloud sat decommisioned recently)
